## Description

Shop Shop is an e-commerce application that allows users to shop for various items, add these products to the shopping cart, manage the shopping cart by increasing and decreasing quantities, check out their purchases and see their order history. This application is built using Node.js, GraphQL, Apollo Server, MongoDB and it is using React for the front end and Redux for state management.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## User Story

AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform<br />
I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API<br />
SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem<br />

GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state<br />
WHEN I review the app’s store<br />
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API<br />
WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store<br />
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider<br />
WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state<br />
THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API<br />
WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store<br />
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API<br />
WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions<br />
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API<br />
